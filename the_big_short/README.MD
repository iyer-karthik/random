The financial crisis is a fascinating example of how human behaviour affects markets. A couple of years ago, I saw the movie 'The Big Short', which is a rivetting look at the 2008 financial crisis
(and starred some of my favorite actors!) The movie was based on Michael Lewis' bestselling book of the same name. I finally got around 
to reading the book. It was initially a bit difficult to parse all the terms in the book (going back and forth from Investopedia is surprisngly difficult.)
This document is my attempt to summarize the contents of the book as I understood them.
