A couple of years ago, I saw the movie 'The Big Short' which was a superbly entertaning look at the 2008 financial crisis
(and starred some of my favorite actors!) The movie was based on Michael Lewis' bestselling book of the same name. I finally got around 
to reading the book. It was initially a bit difficult to parse all the terms in the book (going back and forth from Investopedia, anyone :))
This document is my attempt to summarize the contents of the book as I understood them. 

The financial crisis is a fascinating example of how human behaviour affects markets. This behavioural aspect of finance is something
I am very much interested in and would love to work on it in future!
